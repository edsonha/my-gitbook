# Queue and Stack

Queue and Stack is similar and the difference is how items get removed from this data structure. Unlike array, there is no random access operation, just commands like push, peak and pop which deal exclusively with element at the beginning or the end of the data structure.

Although it sounds limited, it is important concept in computer science because unlike arrays and linked list, we have less methods or less actions that we can perform on stack and queue and sometimes it's good to have these higher level data structure that are built on top of lower level one like linked list and array to limit the operation you can do on them. 

Having limited ability on data structure is an advantage because you can control whoever is using the data structure to only perform the right operation that are efficient. Rather than give somebody all the tools in the world, it is a lot harder for them to operate that if you just give them two or three so that they know exactly what they need to do.
