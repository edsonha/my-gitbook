# Project

### CBI v3

* Streamline \(decrease\) amendment process
* Introduce structured / template of conditions for automation. In the past, the conditions are freehand text of conditions
* No authority / guiding principle to guide how the conditions are written
* Change of activity A =&gt; B where the business activity no longer relevant does not need to "formal amendment process
* G's idea is to split condition into 2 part: fixed and free-hand text
* I's idea is similar to v2, but more of identification which is important and which is not
* Goal of ZeroOps:
* a\) We focus on conditions and OIC focus more on project and company assessment. 
* b\) Focus on automation of SI and more human touch on Non-SI 

### CBI

* Minimize room for errors and downstream issues, e.g. unnecessary amendments.
* Fixing the text saves you time from having to check for formatting issues in the Preview mode or Letter of Award.
* Translate project interests into fixed, clear language
* Ensure conditions are verifiable, and ultimately serves the scheme objectives.
* Standard Incentive \(SI\) is fixed regardless of the achievement
* Regular Incentive \(Non-SI\) is tiered according to the achievement
