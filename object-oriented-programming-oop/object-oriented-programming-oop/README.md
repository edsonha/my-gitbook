# Object Oriented Programming \(OOP\)

Object-Oriented Programming \(OOP\) and Functional Programming \(FP\) are what we called Programming Paradigm which allows us to organize code.

The benefits of OOP are:

1. Codes are clear and understandable
2. Easy to extend - Sub-class extends from super-class
3. Easy to maintain - No need to worry about prototype chains, everything is inherited from super-class and if you want to make a modification, we can modify it from one location
4. Memory efficient - In JS, "Class" make use of reference instead of cloning and copying each other, like in other language like Java
5. Don't Repeat Yourself \(DRY\)

OOP is about bringing together the data \(state\) and its behavior \(method or function\) in a single location called an object or class and containing all of that information in a box makes it easier to understand how our programs work because it is like we are modelling real world objects.

With OOP, there's two main types: class-based programming languages and prototype-based programming languages.
