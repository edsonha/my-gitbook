# Searching and Traversal

**Searching**

* Linear Search O\(n\)

Linear search is a method of finding a target value within the array using loop. Usually the data is unsorted

* Binary Search O\(log\(n\)\)

If our data is sorted, we can do better than O\(n\) because we essentially mimic the property of binary search trees where we can half the items instead of one at a time when looking for something. That is why storing data in a tree-like data structure is more efficient than a linear data structure like an array.

**Traversal**

Traversals simply means visiting every node and the operation is O\(n\) as we are visiting every single node. So how do we go about doing this in a data structure like a tree or graph? We use Breadth First Search and Depth First Search.

* Breadth First Search O\(n\)
* Depth First Search O\(n\)
